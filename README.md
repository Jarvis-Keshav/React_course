# React_course
In my first tutorial I learnt project can be started in two ways
1. react:
   -> npx (node program executer) create-react-app (software) 01basicreact (poject name)
   -> for running commands look for package.json
   -> then ```js  npm run start ```
   -> then ```js npm run build ```
   -> delete the not needed files

3. We'll use ```js vite ```:
   -> npm create vite@latest
   -> write project name and select the rest
   -> then  ```js npm run dev ```
   -> delete the not needed files
